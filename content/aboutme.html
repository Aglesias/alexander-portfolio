        <p>Are you looking for more information about me?</p>
        <p>Then you are in the right place.</p>
        
        <p>My first experience with a video game was playing Mario on the NES at a friend's house when I was about six years old. When my twelve-year older brother then convinced my mother to buy a Mega Drive* to his younger brothers in 1990 I was hooked. And it is the only thing I enjoyed as a child that I still do enjoy—except fishing and foraging.</p>
        
        <p>Even though life took me in different directions, I finally found what I think will be my career from now on until the day I retire. My colleagues often describe me as easy to work with in every position I've held, and as someone who has a strong set of soft skills.</p>
        
        <p>I have a solid understanding of game development and have a good grasp of the C++ programming language. I'm not shy of challanging tasks, love problem solving and am eager to learn more and develop as a game programmer. I prefer to work on-site, as I find I learn more and gain a better understanding of workplace dynamics when I'm physically present. I also am well versed in the agile workflow after developing 8 games during my time at The Game Assembly.</p>
        
        <p>So here I am—a 40-year-old ex-teacher looking for an opportunity to work in the games industry.</p>
