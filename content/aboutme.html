        <p>Are you looking for more information about me?</p>
        <p>Then you are in the right place.</p>
        
        <p>I have a solid understanding of game development and have a good grasp of the C++ programming language. I'm not shy of challanging tasks, love problem solving and am eager to learn more and develop as a game programmer. I prefer to work on-site, as I find I learn more and gain a better understanding of workplace dynamics when I'm physically present. I also am well versed in the agile workflow after developing 8 games during my time at The Game Assembly.</p>
        
        <p>My colleagues often describe me as easy to work with in every position I've held, and as someone who has a strong set of soft skills.</p>
        
        <p>I've now found what I think will be my career from now on until the day I retire since I love programming, solving problems and making games.</p>               
        
        <p>I'm looking for an opportunity to work in the games industry and feel like I have much to give in the gaming industry. Right now I am looking for an internship as a last step in my education.</p>
